spooped
=======
An Android app that lets you haunt locations with spoopy ghosts. Create a ghost, and then when another user passes by it, it will haunt their phone!

#### Testers/Judges
To install the app, get the `app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk` file and install it on your phone.
Either use `adb install` or download it from your phone and open it there. You will need to change security
settings to allow app installs like this.
